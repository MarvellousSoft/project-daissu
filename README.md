## Running the client

Use `love client` from this directory. Notice it must be from this directory so it can access the `common/` directory.

## Running the server

You can just run the server locally with `love server`. Notice it must be from this directory so it can access the `common/` directory. You can also use the Dockerfile to run it.

To deploy the dev server, just run `./deploy_dev.sh`. You should have `docker` installed and logged in to an account that can contribute to that image.
